# Language Encryption and Detection

Language: SQL (Oracle SQL)

Introduction: The purpose of this project is to use SQL to transform multiple datasets relating to customer phone calls over a four month period, to engineer new features, and to combine the datasets into a suitable case table in order to use Machine Learning techniques to predict the likelihood of a customer churning in any given month.

Data Files: The datasets include calls.csv, call_rates.csv, voicemails.csv, customer_service.csv, customers.csv, rate_types.csv, contract_plans. The SQL files are SQLBuild.sql, SQLQueries.sql, and SQLML.sql.

These are I/O Haskell functions designed for two purposes: (1) to encrypt and decrypt text files using a caesar cipher and (2) to detect the language of a text file by comparing character frequency distributions.
