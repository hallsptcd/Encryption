# Language Encryption and Detection

**Language**: Haskell

**Introduction**: These are I/O Haskell functions designed for two purposes: (1) to encrypt and decrypt text files using a caesar cipher and (2) to detect the language of a text file by comparing character frequency distributions.

**Data Files**: The datasets include  call_rates.csv, voicemails.csv, customer_service.csv, customers.csv, rate_types.csv, contract_plans. The SQL files are SQLBuild.sql, SQLQueries.sql, and SQLML.sql.
